Using LaunchKey Clients
***********************

The LaunchKey SDK is broken into credential based factories with access to
functionality based clients.

**Factories**

Factories are based on the credentials supplied. The Organization Factory uses
Organization credentials, the Directory Factory uses Directory credentials,
and the Service Factory uses Service credentials. Each factory provides clients
which are accessible to the factory. The availability is based on the hierarchy
of the entities themselves. Below is a matrix of available services for each
factory.

+--------------+---------------------+------------------+----------------+
| Factory      | Organization Client | Directory Client | Service Client |
+==============+=====================+==================+================+
| Organization |         Yes         |       Yes        |      Yes       |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------+----------------+
| Directory    |         No          |       Yes        |      Yes       |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------+----------------+
| Service      |         No          |       No         |      Yes       |
+--------------+---------------------+------------------+----------------+

**Using individual clients**

.. code-block:: python

    from launchkey.factories import ServiceFactory, DirectoryFactory

    directory_id = "37d98bb9-ac71-44b7-9ac0-5d75e31e627a"
    directory_private_key = open('directory_private_key.key').read()
    service_id = "9ecc57e0-fb0f-4971-ba12-399b630158b0"
    service_private_key = open('service_private_key.key').read()

    directory_factory = DirectoryFactory(directory_id, directory_private_key)
    directory_client = directory_factory.make_directory_client()

    service_factory = ServiceFactory(service_id, service_private_key)
    service_client = service_factory.make_service_client()

**Using a hierarchical client**

.. code-block:: python

    from launchkey.factories import OrganizationFactory

    organization_id = "bff1602d-a7b3-4dbe-875e-218c197e9ea6"
    organization_private_key = open('organization_private_key.key').read()
    directory_id = "37d98bb9-ac71-44b7-9ac0-5d75e31e627a"
    service_id = "9ecc57e0-fb0f-4971-ba12-399b630158b0"
    user = "my_unique_internal_identifier"

    organization_factory = OrganizationFactory(
        organization_id, organization_private_key)
    directory_client = organization_factory.make_directory_client(directory_id)
    service_client = organization_factory.make_service_client(service_id)

Linking And Managing Users
**************************

In order to link a user you will need to start the linking process then display
the qrcode to them, give them the code, or both.

.. code-block:: python

    link_data = directory_client.link_device(user)
    linking_code = link_data.code
    qr_url = link_data.qrcode

If desired you can retrieve the user's devices and unlink then directly from
the SDK

.. code-block:: python

    devices = directory_client.get_linked_devices(user)
    directory_client.unlink_device(user, devices[0].id)

You can also end all of a user's sessions

.. code-block:: python

    directory_client.end_all_service_sessions(user)

Logging A User In
*****************

Create an auth request to initiate the login process

.. code-block:: python

    auth = service_client.authorization_request(user)
    auth_request_id = auth.auth_request

Using Dynamic Policies

.. code-block:: python

    from launchkey.entities.service import AuthPolicy
    # Require 2 factors and don't allow any jailbroken or rooted devices
    policy = AuthPolicy(any=2, jailbreak_protection=True)
    # Also make it so the user can only log in from the Portland area
    policy.add_geofence(
        latitude=45.48805749706375, longitude=-122.70492553710936, radius=27500)
    auth_request_id = service_client.authorization_request(user, policy=policy)


Check whether a response has been received and check whether it has been
authorized

.. code-block:: python

    from launchkey.exceptions import RequestTimedOut
    from time import sleep
    response = None
    try:
        while response is None:
            response = service_client.get_authorization_response(auth_request_id)
            if response is not None:
                if response.authorized is True:
                    # User accepted the auth, now create a session
                    service_client.session_start(user, auth_request_id)
                else:
                    # User denied the auth request
            else:
                sleep(1)
    except RequestTimedOut:
        # The user did not respond to the request in the timeout period (5 minutes)

When a user logs out

.. code-block:: python

    service_client.session_end(user)

Dealing with Webhooks
*********************

Webhooks can be used in opposition to polling. This means we will hit your app
on either an auth response or logout request.

You will use the same handle_webhook method for both login and logout.

**Note that request.headers must be a dictionary like object.**

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import Flask, request
    from launchkey.entities.service import AuthorizationResponse, \
        SessionEndRequest

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Path defined in your Service Callback URL value
    @app.route('/launchkey', methods = ['POST'])
    def launchkey_webhook():
        package = service_client.handle_webhook(request.data, request.headers,
                                                request.method, request.path)
        if isinstance(package, AuthorizationResponse):
            if package.authorized is True:
                # User accepted the auth, now create a session
                service_client.session_start(user, auth_request_id)
            else:
                # User denied the auth
                handle_denial()
        elif isinstance(package, SessionEndRequest):
            # The package will have the user hash, so use it to log the user out
            # based on however you are handling it
            logout_user_from_my_app(package.service_user_hash)

Running Tests
-------------

Running tests is as simple as::

    python setup.py test


Validating Code
---------------

The LaunchKey Service SDK supports and number of python versions and has
fairly strict coding guidelines.
Tests require a number of Python versions. The best way to manage these
versions is with pyenv_. You will need to register all of the versions with
pyenv. There are a couple ways to do that. An example of doing it globally is::

    pyenv global 2.7.15 3.4.9 3.5.6 3.6.6 3.7.0 3.8-dev pypy3.5-6.0.0 pypy2.7-6.0.0

Install dependencies via Pipenv

    pipenv install --dev

Run validation::

    pipenv run tox
