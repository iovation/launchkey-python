Feature: Service Client Authorization Request: Get Device Response Policy - New Format
  In order to understand an auth response
  As a Directory Service
  I can retrieve an Authorization Requests that been responded to and determine the policy that was last processed by the device in the new policy format
â€‹
  Background:
    Given I created a Directory
    And I have added an SDK Key to the Directory
    And I created a Directory Service
    And I have a linked device

  Scenario: Verify that a Factors Policy can be parsed
    When I create a new Factors Policy
    And I set the factors to "INHERENCE"
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
    Then the Advanced Authorization response should require Inherence
    And the Advanced Authorization response should have the requirement "TYPES"

  Scenario: Verify that a Method Amount Policy can be parsed
    When I create a new MethodAmountPolicy
    And I set the amount to "2"
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
    Then the Advanced Authorization response should have amount set to 2
    And the Advanced Authorization response should have the requirement "AMOUNT"

  Scenario: Verify that a Conditional Geofence Policy can be parsed
    Given the Directory Service is set to any Conditional Geofence Policy
    When I add the following GeoCircleFence items
    | latitude | longitude | radius  | name        |
    | 41       | -141      | 234400  | Large Fence |
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
    Then the Advanced Authorization response should contain a GeoCircleFence with a radius of 234400, a latitude of 41, a longitude of -141, and a name of "Large Fence"
    And the Advanced Authorization response should have the requirement "COND_GEO"

  Scenario: Verify that GeoCircleFence fences can be parsed from Fences on a Factors Policy
    When I create a new Factors Policy
    And I set the factors to "KNOWLEDGE"
    And I add the following GeoCircleFence items
    | latitude | longitude | radius | name        |
    | 45.1250  | 150.51    | 15200  | Large Fence |
    | -50.01   | -140      | 100    | Small Fence |
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
    Then the Advanced Authorization response should contain a GeoCircleFence with a radius of 15200, a latitude of 45.1250, a longitude of 150.51, and a name of "Large Fence"
    And the Advanced Authorization response should contain a GeoCircleFence with a radius of 100, a latitude of -50.01, a longitude of -140, and a name of "Small Fence"
    And the Advanced Authorization response should have the requirement "TYPES"

  Scenario: Verify that GeoCircleFence fences can be parsed from Fences on a Methods Amount Policy
    When I create a new MethodAmountPolicy
    And I add the following GeoCircleFence items
    | latitude | longitude | radius | name        |
    | 45.1250  | 150.51    | 15200  | Large Fence |
    | -50.01   | -140      | 100    | Small Fence |
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
    Then the Advanced Authorization response should contain a GeoCircleFence with a radius of 15200, a latitude of 45.1250, a longitude of 150.51, and a name of "Large Fence"
    And the Advanced Authorization response should contain a GeoCircleFence with a radius of 100, a latitude of -50.01, a longitude of -140, and a name of "Small Fence"
    And the Advanced Authorization response should have the requirement "AMOUNT"

  Scenario: Verify that TerritoryFence fences can be parsed from Fences on a Factors Policy
    When I create a new Factors Policy
    And I set the factors to "KNOWLEDGE"
    And I add the following TerritoryFence items
    | country | admin_area | postal_code | name  |
    | US      | US-NV      | 89120       | US-NV |
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
    Then the Advanced Authorization response should contain a TerritoryFence with a country of "US", a administrative area of "US-NV", a postal code of "89120", and a name of "US-NV"
    And the Advanced Authorization response should have the requirement "TYPES"

  Scenario: Verify that TerritoryFence fences can be parsed from Fences on a Methods Amount Policy
    When I create a new MethodAmountPolicy
    And I add the following TerritoryFence items
    | country | admin_area | postal_code | name  |
    | US      | US-NV      | 89120       | US-NV |
    And I set the Advanced Policy for the Current Directory Service to the new policy
    And I make an Authorization request
    And I deny the auth request
    And I get the response for the Advanced Authorization request
