  In order to verify User TOTP codes
  As a Service Client

    And I created a Directory Service
    And I have created a User TOTP

  Scenario: Verifying a valid User TOTP code returns true
    When I verify a TOTP code with a valid code
    Then the TOTP verification response is True

    When I verify a TOTP code with an invalid code
    Then the TOTP verification response is False
